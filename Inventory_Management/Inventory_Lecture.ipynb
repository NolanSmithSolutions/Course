    "Inventory is a term accountants use to describe the assets on hand that a company intends to sell as a part of its primary business activity.  For example, when a box factory sells boxes to a meat packer, it has sold its inventory.  Conversely, when that same box factory sells off some of it's receivables (I.O.U.s from other companies) it is NOT selling its inventory.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For most manufacturing based businesses, inventory typically ties up more capital throughout a calendar year than any other asset with the exception of PP&E (property, plant & equipment), so most of these companies have a huge interest in managing it efficiently.  In this lecture, we will examine a hypothical company's current inventory position, discuss why it may be good or bad, propose a possible path for improvement, and conclude with a discussion on why inventory optimization is a critical component to the success of modern companies.  \n",

The first force is production capabilities.  For the purposes of this lecture we will assume that the manufacturing sites are built to adequatly produce any needed amount of inventory, and that raw materials are not in short supply. \n",

    "The other driving force is product demand.  If people are only buying a few hundred units from a company, it would be silly to manufacture millions.  On the other hand, if demand for the product is going off the charts, a company will need to make sure it sustains enough inventory to satisfy its customers, and not miss out on potential sales. Companies will typically dedicate huge amounts of resources to study market sentiment and guage what product demand will be.  For this lecture, a hypothetical demand forecast is provided.   "

    "## A note on Weeks of Supply\n",
    "When measuring a company's inventory, it is often helpful to look at both absolte measures of inventory (such as number of units) as well as relative measures of inventory such as weeks of supply.  In general, weeks of supply is calculated as inventory in week 0 divided by the average of the demand for that inventory in weeks 1 ,2 ,3 , & 4.  This relative measure will allow us to compare relative efficient use of various products as well as areas that need attention.  "
