    "Unlike most other programming languages, SQL is not designed for computations, instead SQL is used to interact and pull data out of data sets which can then be used by other languages to do analysis.  Additionally, SQL allows its users to grab data from any number of data sets simultaneously, so long as a relationship exists between them.  With SQL (pronounced like \"sequel\"), tables are the data organization structure. A table has a fixed number of named columns and a table row represents a single data record which contains one unique value for each column.  An example can be seen below in which a table represents a student's name, age and major with each row representing a different student.\n",

    "First, we will start with the basics by importing 2 widely used packages into python, \"sqlite3\" which allows us to interact with SQL databases and \"pandas\" which is sort of like a souped-up version of excel in programming languages that works great with manipulating and presenting table data."

    "SQL can be used to create tables without existing data or to pull directly from existing databases.  Populating small tables of data by hand is inefficient for larger databases but works well with demonstrations.  You can create a table in SQL using statements in this format:\n",

    "  SELECT [val5]             , [val6]             , ...;\n",
    "</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we wanted to create a table called resume_experience which contains columns for Years, City, Occupation, and Cost of Living you would write something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<code>\n",
    "  CREATE TABLE resume_experience AS\n",
